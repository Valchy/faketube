# Valchy FakeTube

YouTube player to browse and watch ad-free videos using their built in embeded player. There is also the functionality to download videos directly as a MP4 file, though this does not work always as I am using thr API of a third party service. And finally, there is a playlist option which uses firebase/firestore as the backend database with real-time data sync so that changes to a playlist take effect on all users instantly. Share and listen custom YouTube playlists via link or QR code.

PS This was built for a university project
