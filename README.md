YouTube player to browse and watch ad-free videos using their built-in embedded player. There is also the functionality to download videos directly as an MP4 file, though this does not work always as I am using the API of a third-party service. And finally, there is a playlist option that uses firebase/firestore as the backend database with real-time data sync so that changes to a playlist take effect on all users instantly. Share and listen to custom YouTube playlists via a link or QR code.

PS This was built for a university project
